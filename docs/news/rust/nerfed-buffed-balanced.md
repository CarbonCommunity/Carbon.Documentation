One of the loudest bits of feedback we heard after last month's Jungle update: “I can’t find anything!” Fair. The jungle was a bit too good at being a jungle. Below are several key areas we've made improvements to.

Wild **hemp** has been reworked with taller stalks and purple flowers, so you can actually see it against the overgrowth. (Player-grown hemp remains unchanged.)

More **ore** nodes now spawn throughout the jungle thanks to increased rock formation density and a general boost to ore availability.

**Berry** bushes have their own dedicated Jungle population to help keep food distribution more even across the map.

Cars and bikes now spawn along jungle road sides, you’ll no longer feel stranded in the canopy.

Players no longer spawn directly in the jungle biome. It’ll still generate near spawn areas, but you won’t be dropped in the middle of the Jungle unless you choose to live there.

Additionally, we've added several new trees that did not quite make it into the initial release.

We’ve also made improvements on monument distribution. This has been a long-standing issue, and it worsened with last month's Jungle update. Good news, it's fixed! Overall, you can now expect a healthy increase in the number of monuments per map.

Some key highlights in the testing world sizes of 4500:
Airfield +37%
Trainyard +34%
Excavator +45%
Military Tunnels +28%
Powerplant +17%
Water Treatment +16%
Sewer Branch +14%
Overall, we hope all these changes bring Jungle into a balanced position.

I've made some changes to the incapacitate dart, making it less OP, but still useful. 

There's now a blur and dim effect instead of the full screen blackout, and the fade speed has been decreased.

The movement speed reduction duration has also been decreased from 6 to 4 seconds, to match the blur duration.
