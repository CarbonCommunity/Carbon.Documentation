# Minimal

Carbon's minimal build, focused solely on plugin execution, stripping away Carbon exclusive features for the most part.

## Differences

Here's a list of all of the differences between regular Carbon builds and Minimal:

<table tabindex="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Feature</th>
      <th style="text-align: center; min-width: 100px">Carbon</th>
      <th style="text-align: center; min-width: 100px">Minimal</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr v-for="feature in features">
    <td>
      <strong>{{feature.name}}</strong>
      <div style="opacity: 50%; font-size: smaller">
        {{feature.desc}} <a v-if="feature.link != null" :href="feature.link">Learn more.</a>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td><div style="opacity: 50%; font-size: smaller">âœ… Present</div></td>
    <td><div style="opacity: 50%; font-size: smaller">ðŸš« Absent</div></td>
  </tr>
</table>


:::tip ðŸ”¥ Release Optimizations
All Minimal builds have Release optimisations and reduced debugging data. They're essentially **Release builds**.
