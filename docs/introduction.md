::: info
**Carbon** is a modding framework that is dedicated to take care of all background processing and execution of customized plugins and extensions in the most optimal way possible.

This project is designed to work as close as the way Oxide does, with slight interface adjustments but with the sole purpose of allowing most Oxide-dedicated plugins, work in Carbon's environment.
:::

An anticipated system designed to execute **existent** Oxide plugins, all within Harmony **without** any patches, for optimised performance purposes.
