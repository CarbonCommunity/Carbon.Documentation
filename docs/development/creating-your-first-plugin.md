# üêí Creating your First Plugin

If you‚Äôre looking at creating Oxide-compatible plugins, it‚Äôs as easy as you‚Äôve always known it. It uses the same syntax, naming and formatting as regular Oxide plugins.

```csharp:line-numbers
namespace Oxide.Plugins
{
    [Info ( "Template", "<author>", "1.0.0" )]
    [Description ( "<optional_description>" )]
    public class Template : RustPlugin
    {
        private void OnServerInitialized ()
        {
            Puts ( "Hello world!" );
        }
    }
}
```

## CarbonPlugin

If you‚Äôre looking to create Carbon-only plugins, which extends the functionality of regular Oxide plugins, and brings you more tools for easing the development of your plugins, you may now use **CarbonPlugin** as your file‚Äôs inheritance.

```csharp:line-numbers
namespace Carbon.Plugins
{
    [Info ( "Template", "<author>", "1.0.0" )]
    [Description ( "<optional_description>" )]
    public class Template : CarbonPlugin
    {
        private void OnServerInitialized ()
        {
            Puts ( "Hello world!" );
        }
    }
}
```
